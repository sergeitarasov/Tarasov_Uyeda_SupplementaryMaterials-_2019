This repository contains files necessary to reproduce all statistical analyses discussed in our paper that re-analyzes data from *Blasi et al. (2019)*. The preprint of our study is available at [*biorxiv*](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.20.957407v1).

The detail description of the analyses is given in *Analyses_Description.pdf*
